"""The U device. Universal device, unknown device, U. Any U name reaches it.

Three faces: 1, 0 and u. It combines them without ever turning u into a guess,

The fingerprint at the bottom is computed from the four functions above it.
It is not read from a docstring. Delete this header and it comes out the same.
